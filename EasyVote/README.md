# EasyVote
EasyVote is the concept of an hybrid (electronic/paper) voting system that has been developed within the project "Constitutional Compliant Electronic Voting" (Verfassungskonforme Umsetzung von elektronischen Wahlen ) which was funded by the "DFG - Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft". This project contains a web-based implementation of EasyVote.

# Municipal Elections Karlsruhe
This version represents the election rules used in Baden-Württemberg. It is implemented for the municipal elections of Karlsruhe 2019.
This implementation is based on the php code of EasyVote of [SECUSO](https://github.com/SecUSo/EasyVote-web), the QR code is not visible to the user and hence, is not used for submitting votes. It should only be used to "practise" how to vote (cumulate and split) with the complex rules in Baden-Würrtemberg. Furthermore, it is only implemented in German and the existing source code was only changed minimally.

The complete source code could be found in the [parent directory](https://github.com/felix-seifert/EasyVote-web).
